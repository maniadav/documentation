## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight containers. Containers bundle an application with all its dependencies and configurations.

## Docker Images vs Containers

- **Docker Image**: A read-only template that includes the application and all its dependencies.
- **Docker Container**: A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

### Key Differences:

- **Image**: Immutable, used to create containers.
- **Container**: Mutable, an instance of an image that can be stopped, started, and modified.

## Docker Commands

### Working with Images

- **List all Docker images**:

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- **Pull an image from Docker Hub**:

  ```bash
  docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
  ```
- **Build an image from a Dockerfile**:

  ```bash
  docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
  ```
- **Remove an image**:

  ```bash
  docker rmi <image_name>:<tag>
  ```

### Working with Containers

- **Run a container**:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
  ```

  - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode (in the background).
  - `--name`: Assign a custom name to the container.
- **List all running containers**:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **List all containers (including stopped)**:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
- **Stop a running container**:

  ```bash
  docker stop <container_name>
  ```
- **Remove a container**:

  ```bash
  docker rm <container_name>
  ```
- **Inspect a container** (view container's metadata):

  ```bash
  docker inspect <container_name>
  ```

## Docker Authentication

- **Login to Docker Hub**:
  To access private Docker repositories or to push your images, you need to authenticate:
  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

## Build Docker Container

To build a Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <container-name-with-version> .
```

This command builds an image based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory and tags it with the specified name and version.

## Run Your Container

To run a container from an image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 <container-name-with-version>
```

This command maps the host's port 3000 to the container's port 3000, allowing you to access the application on `localhost:3000`.

## Starting a New Container With Specific Name

To start a container with a specified name and port mapping:

```bash
docker run --name <container_name> -p 8080:80 <container_image_with_version>
```

This command starts a new container named `<container_name>` and maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your host.

## List Docker Containers

To list all containers, including stopped ones:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## Remove a Container

To remove a stopped container by its ID:

```bash
docker rm <container ID>
```

## List Running Containers

To list only running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Stop a Running Container

To stop a running container:

```bash
docker stop <container name>
```

## Remove a Running Container

To remove a running container:

```bash
docker rm <container name>
```

## Rename a Container

To rename an existing container:

```bash
docker rename <from_name> <to_name>
```

## Production/Development Docker Environment

When developing and deploying with Docker, itâ€™s common to have different configurations for development and production.

### Separate Development and Production Modes

- For **development**, you may want to mount volumes and use tools like `nodemon` to automatically reload the app without rebuilding the container every time.
- For **production**, you will typically want optimized containers that run in detached mode without the need for code changes or hot reloading.

### Enable Hot-Reloading with Volumes

In development, use Docker volumes to mount your local code directory into the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5500:5500 -v $(pwd):/app <image-name>
```

### Simplify the Development Workflow

Install `nodemon` and `tsc` in your dev environment. Then, use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart the application when changes are detected.

---

### **Development Dockerfile**

For development, use a Dockerfile like the following:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js Alpine image for smaller builds.
FROM node:23-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and lockfile for dependency installation
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . ./

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 5500

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=development
ENV PORT=5500
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"

# Default command for development
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### **Running the Development Container**

1. Build the container

   ```
   docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t rock-oak-backend-dev .
   ```

   Run the Docker Container with Hot-Reloading**:
   Use Docker volumes to map your local code to the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5500:5500 -v $(pwd):/app rock-oak-backend-dev
   ```
2. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed in the Container**:
   If you modify `package.json`, rebuild or reinstall dependencies inside the container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-id> npm install
   ```
3. **Use `npm run dev`**:
   The `dev` script uses `nodemon` and `tsc` to watch for changes and restart the server automatically.

### **Production Dockerfile**

For production, use a different Dockerfile, `Dockerfile.prod`, optimized for production:

```dockerfile
FROM node:23-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and lockfile
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install production dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . ./

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 5500

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=5500
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

To build and run for production:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
docker run -p 5500:5500 <image-name>
```
